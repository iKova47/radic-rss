# Radić
World's most hard-working, hardly-working RSS reader.

## The name
The name, pronounced as /ɹædɪtʃ/, has two meanings:
 - From my misspelling of the word **Read** as **Rad**, and the word **Rad** meaning **Work** in the Croatian language, and since this app is hardly working, I added the **ić** suffix to the word to denounce that the app barely works.
 - Word **Radić**, excepts for being used as a surname, translates as the [Radicchio plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicchio) (hence the logo)
